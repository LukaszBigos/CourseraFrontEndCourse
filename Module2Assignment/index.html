  <h1>Here is the list of three enduro bikes I would like to have:)</h1>
  <section class="canyon">
    <h2>Canyon Strive</h2>
    <p>
      It’s rare that anything able to scramble up slopes this easily can rip so hard on the way back down.
      Thanks to Shapeshifter, the Strive makes the impossible possible - it is the ultimate enduro bike.
      The revolutionary on-the-fly system provides two distinctly different settings for geometry,
      suspension kinematics and travel.
      As a result, the Strive climbs with absolute efficiency in XC mode and bombs down the rowdiest descents in DH mode.
      That’s why it’s the ride of choice for the Canyon Factory Enduro Team. Give every trail a new dimension!

  <section class="meta">
    <h2>Commencal Meta V4</h2>
    <p>
      Commencal’s Meta V4 Race looks pleasantly simple from any viewing angle.
      Its shock is tucked into a forged-aluminum pocket, welded into the top tube’s midsection,
      while the rocker system which drives it is styled to blend into the frame’s conventional-looking double-diamond profile.
      Its rear suspension is intentionally low tech. The single-pivot swingarm,
      with its clevis dropout pivots and semi-rectangular stays could have been ordered from the Sears catalogue
      – and that may be a good thing, because its kinematics are the stuff of which all the fancy patented mechanisms
      are still measured by, and the stuff of which precious few have managed to better.

  <section class="reign">
    <h2>Giant Reign</h2>
    <p>
      The frame of the all-new Reign 27.5 is engineered with Giant’s ALUXX SL material and  27.5-specific geometry.
      It offers 6.3 inches (160mm) of Maestro rear suspension travel and a longer,
      lower chassis than its 26-inch-wheel predecessor. This improves stability and handling on rough terrain without sacrificing
      stiffness or adding weight. The Reign 27.5 model also features an OverDrive steerer tube design for added front-end
      stiffness and steering precision, along with a new 12x142 rear thru-axle design and internal cable ports—including
      routing for dropper seatposts—to give it a sleek, uncluttered appearance and performance.
